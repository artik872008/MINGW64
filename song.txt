A small town at the coast of Eire
Well known for its harbor it was
Where a life was easily lost\n
In the claws of whiskey and desire

I was a poor worker, loading the ships
Of them I knew a lot, but one I did not
It belonged to five mariners, and somewhat
They seemed not to be here to joke and to quip
